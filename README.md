This project looks at different machine learning models to try and predict a groups performance doing a small task. 

To run the code you will need to download both GAP-corpus files and Audio files and put them in this folder. 
you can find both files here: https://sites.google.com/view/gap-corpus/home
Make sure to check file paths in the code before running. 
During testing the code took around 21 minutes to completely run. Most of this time taken was getting the sound data from each of the groups. 

To run the project all you need to do is run the runProject.py file.
